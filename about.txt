== Directory Structure ==

I (stephen) may have overengineered this but I figured we could stay organized early and keep from
stepping on each others toes because git and Godot are not always the best of friends.

I stole pretty much all of this idea from DevDuck's video on how he organizes his project. It's not
set in stone, but it might be helpful for us to get started: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4az0VX9ApcA

In general, most things are going to end up in the entities directory. This is pretty much anything that's visible
or any things that are specific to an entity. A room might be an entity and we should consider making it so we can 
give that room it's own music if we want to so it might look like

Entities
 -> Environments
  -> GreenHouse
	 -> Audio
	   -> somesound.mp3
	 -> Sprite (for the look of the room)
	 -> Items
	
Somehting like that. Still a lot to think about in terms of how to lay out our clues or interactable objects.
